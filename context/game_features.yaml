      - question: What is WordTrip?
        answer: |
          WordTrip is a simple word puzzle game that lets you exercise your brain and chill out at the same time!

          It's based on anagrams and how many you can find.

          The story takes you around the world, across countries, with the magical Compass of words!
      - question: How to play?
        answer: |
          It's as easy as ABC!

          You need to find words hidden in the Compass. Slide & drag your finger over the letters to form required words and solve the puzzle.

          The number of letters increase as you progress and the puzzles get trickier.

          Your Wisdom score increases as you progress across countries and the aim is to go on a ''World Tour''!
      - question: What are coins?
        answer: Coins make up the basic currency system of the game. They are used to get hints, when stuck on a puzzle.
      - question: What is wisdom score?
        answer: |
          The Wisdom Score is there to measure how far you have progressed in the game. The longer your Streak is on a puzzle, the more Wisdom you earn!

          Wisdom score is accumulated and can be used to rank higher than other players, but the score isn't spent like coins. The number of green leaves you get is equal to every word you solve, depending on the Streak!
      - question: Using hints
        answer: |
          If you are stuck on the puzzle and need help, you can get it by using hints.

          Hints reveal the letters for you on the grid. Using hints costs you coins. Press the 'HINTS' button at the side of the puzzle screen to reveal a letter.

          The puzzle is automatically cleared once all letters are revealed.
      - question: How do the hints work?
        answer: |
          **Main/Spell Bee puzzle screen:**
          1. Normal hint reveals a letter in the puzzle.
          2. Burst hint reveals 6 random letters in the puzzle.

          **VIP Puzzle screen:**
          1. Normal hint can reveal up to 2 letters (Digraph letter) on the puzzle.
          2. Burst hint can reveal up to 12 letters (Digraph letter) on the puzzle.
      - question: How do I get more hints?
        answer: |
          There are several ways to earn hints:

          1. Collect your daily bonus for a chance at receiving a hint as a reward.
          2. Take part in events and competitions. The treasure chests you get as a reward for winning may contain hints.
          3. Using the spinner. The Spinner may land on the hints as a lucky reward.
          4. You can buy bundle of coin and hint packs in the store as an in-app purchase.
      - question: Ask for help
        answer: |

          This will share a screen and a link to the game as well.
      - question: Using Shuffle
        answer: The Shuffle option will only re-arrange the letters on the Compass. This will give you a new perspective of looking at them and help in trying to make those last few words.
      - question: Using the spinner
        answer: |
          Located at the top of the puzzle screen, the Spinner is a handy tool and is meant to help you along the way.

    description: Information about game words, puzzles, and dictionary.
    topics:
      - question: Valid words and required words
        answer: |
          1. Each puzzle has certain 'Required words' that you have to find to solve the puzzle.
          2. You might find a lot of 'Valid words'. The key is to find the ones that we have hidden!
          3. For each puzzle, you know the lengths of the words to be found, by counting the empty letter tiles above the puzzle.
          4. The 'extra' Valid words you find will help you out later!
          5. All words (almost) in the English dictionary are considered Valid words. Offensive words, abbreviations, prefixes, suffixes or any word that might be offensive are strictly disallowed. If you have any queries about a particular word or puzzle, let us know by hitting the Help button below.
      - question: Puzzle not solvable
        answer: |
          Sometimes, you might feel that a certain puzzle is just not solvable. We have received many such queries.

          These are not bugs, but rather a part of the game challenge! Not all valid words are always accepted, and it is the words required in the puzzle that have to found.

          All puzzles are solvable! We've personally solved each and every one of them!
      - question: How hard do the puzzles get? What is the maximum number of letters in a puzzle?
        answer: The largest puzzles include words with 8 letters. The puzzles do get larger and more difficult as the game progress.
      - question: How do I report an offensive word or definition?
        answer: |
          While we do use a third-party dictionary for word definitions, we are able to edit any offensive definitions.

          Please send us a screenshot of the word and level number through the Contact Us feature and we will have it reviewed.
      - question: Do you accept all words as bonus words?
        answer: |
          We're not able to accept all possible words as bonus words. The goal is to use the letters provided to find a set of bonus words that you will receive extra coins for.

          Also, proper nouns such as places, people, days of the week and generally any word that is always capitalized or derogatory in any form will not count as a bonus word.
      - question: A word didn't swipe on my first attempt.
        answer: |
          Typically this happens if a word was entered incorrectly. Either the letters were swiped out of order or a letter didn't quite connect.

          If you believe a bug that is causing some other sort of issue, any screenshot or more detailed explanations would be appreciated so we can look into it further.

              1. Facebook was connected on old device. You just have to log into Facebook through the game on your new device, and give it a few seconds to sync.

              2. Facebook was not connected on old device. We request you to use your old device and log into Facebook through the game. This will sync the data with the cloud. Now, if you log into Facebook through the game on your new device, your progress will be updated in a few seconds.
          - question: Lost my progress
            answer: |
              Game progress gets reset when the application's cache or data is cleared from the device, or you logout of Facebook. Do not clear the application data if you are not connected to Facebook. We recommend connecting your account to Facebook to ensure that the progress gets saved on our servers.

              1. Facebook not connected & progress lost. If you have lost the progress before connecting, drop an email by clicking the Help button below. We will try to restore your data, but in certain cases, they might be lost entirely.

              2. Facebook connected & progress lost. If you had connected to Facebook, you can get your progress back by re-logging into Facebook through the game and playing the game for a few seconds till the data is synced.

              3. Progress lost on Facebook logout Don't worry. You just need to re-login to Facebook from your game.
      - question: Sounds & Music
        subtopics:
          - question: Can I turn on or off the music or sound effects?
            answer: You can adjust the sounds in the settings of the game. There is a toggle for the game music and sound effects.
          - question: Sound effects are missing!
            answer: |
              1. Check the game settings to make sure sounds and music are turned on.
              2. If all the settings are fine and the sound is still off, try restarting the game app.
              3. If that doesn't help, try restarting your device.

              That usually fixes the sound problem. If not, try the following:
              1. Make sure your device is not muted and that the volume is turned up high enough.

              If none of that worked, open another application to make sure your device sound is working in general. If the problem persists, it probably has to do with your device itself rather than the game.
          - question: Music Off still able to hear ad sounds!
            answer: |
              If the game sounds are bugging you, you can turn them off from the Settings from the home screen.

              But sounds from ads are out of our control, and if this is the problem, please try reducing the media volume by pressing the volume down key while an ad plays.

      - question: Connecting to a FB account
        answer: |
          You can connect to Facebook in game settings.

          Please follow these steps to connect your game to your facebook account:
          1. Tap on Menu icon in the upper right corner of the screen to open Settings.
          2. Tap on Login & Play option.
          3. You will be redirected to Facebook, where you will be asked to login.
          4. Enter your facebook credentials.
          5. Tap Continue. After your FB account is connected to WordTrip, you will be redirected back to the game.
      - question: How does Facebook sync works?
        answer: |
          1. If you're connecting your game via Facebook ID (which has never been used in this game) all your guest user progress and coins will get copied and additional 100 coins will get added.

          2. If you're connecting your game via Facebook ID (which is used already in this game) then all your progress will get overwritten by Facebook progress.

          Once you log in, the system takes some time to restore your progress - this depends on your internet speed. Please continue playing for a few minutes till your progress gets restored.
          It may take a few seconds based on your internet connection and speed.
      - question: Cannot connect to Facebook
        answer: |
          1. Make sure you have a stable internet connection.
          2. Check to see if your username and password are correct.
          3. If you have the Facebook app installed on your device, log out of it(or delete and reinstall it).
          4. Log out of your Facebook account in all browsers installed on your device(Chrome, Opera, Safari, etc.).
          5. Restart your device and try to connect the game to Facebook again.
      - question: How do I reinstall/restart the game?
        answer: |
          Reinstalling or restarting a game can often solve most of the problems you may encounter.

          To restart a game, simply force quit the application and launch it again.

          Reinstalling a game may be trickier. Please follow these steps to avoid losing your game progress:
          1. Make sure your game is connected to your Facebook account.
          2. Go to settings > Apps, choose the Word Trip game and tap Delete.
          3. Restart your device.
          4. Go to the Application store and download the app again.
          5. Make sure to check that you have a stable internet connection before you launch the game.

      - question: What to do if "No Ads Available" message appears?
        answer: |
          Dear Customers,
          Unfortunately sometimes there might be a limit to the number of video ads one can watch.

          "No ads available" message simply means that advertising providers do not have videos available to you at the moment. The lack of ads is not a bug. When tapped "w2e icon" we try to find video ads for you and load them. If no videos were found this time, "No Ads Available", message appears.

          Please don't worry, video ads will surely become available later and you will be able to earn coins for watching them.
      - question: Why don't I have an event that another player has?
        answer: |
          We do our best to ensure that the same events are available to all the players. However, sometimes they may not show on your device because of the following reasons:
          1. The event may have been available for a limited time.
          2. You might have not cleared the eligibility criteria to enter the event.
          3. Your game might not be updated to the latest version
          But don't worry, our team is constantly working on new events, and they will become available to you soon!
      - question: Missing Leaderboard events
        answer: The remaining puzzles on your game are not sufficient to participate in tournament. We will be sending a new set off exciting puzzles very soon, so that you will be able to take part in tournaments.

        answer: If you think someone is cheating during a competition, take a screenshot of their name and profile picture and contact our customer Support with a description of the problem.

        answer: |

        answer: The Spell Bee puzzles appear once every 24 hours. Players try to collect as many bees as possible when playing the puzzle.
