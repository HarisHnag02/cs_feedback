### 🔭 Long-Term (Quarterly)

- **Build a real-time feedback loop** — move from reactive analysis to proactive monitoring.
- **Segment feedback by payer cohort** — payer vs non-payer pain differs and needs separate product responses.

## 🔬 Feedback Intelligence System Critique

> How well did the AI analysis actually work? What to improve.

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Generic 'Other' category usage | 0 (0.0%) | 🟢 Acceptable |
| Low-confidence classifications (<0.7) | 24 | 🟡 Review manually |
| Tickets without feature mapping | 102 | 🟡 Improve feature taxonomy in context |

**Improvement Recommendations:**

- Add game-specific categories (e.g., 'Level Difficulty', 'IAP Value', 'Progression Loss') to the AI prompt
- Include player ARPU/payer tier data if available to enable payer-specific analysis
- Track sentiment trends over time (weekly deltas) to detect degradation early
- Add duplicate/near-duplicate detection to avoid skewing frequency counts
- Build a confidence threshold filter — tickets below 0.65 confidence should be human-reviewed
